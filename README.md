# Papers-published
Here I present files for the papers i've published in my scientific career since 2018. For the papers I don't have legal permission to share, you can use the sciHub(https://sci-hub.do/) to get it (for your responsability). More information can be found at my lattes profile (http://lattes.cnpq.br/1056892310025226) and at my ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cleber_Souza5).
